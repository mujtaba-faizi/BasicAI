# BasicAI  

## Introduction to the problem area:-  
The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing rapidly and being applied in many of daily-life routines. Starting from mere face recognition softwares to automated cars, AI has proved to be very helpful to mankind in solving the biggest of problems.
In this regard, we have created a mobile app that provides a very easy-to-use interface, to show the basic concepts/applications of AI, mainly machine learning (ML). Following are the aims this app will achieve: 
1.	Provide helpful tips/explanation with examples, regarding the terms and algorithms used in AI. 
2.	The students will understand the various model improvement techniques, and why they are used.
3. Provide facial recognition by showing names associated with faces of people (using a trained model).
4.	Show object recognition by showing names of objects after taking their pictures from the phone camera (using a pre-trained model that shows percentage inclination of an object, like picture of a bottle may produce the output: 70% bottle).
5.	In the image analysis domain, students will be able to upload their pictures and play around. They can also see their histograms structure & how to identify various important features associated with them.

## Target Audience: 

The audience in this case, would be the students of K-12. Different schools may refer this app to the students for self-learning or add it as a tool for usage in their computer courses.

## Need Analysis:
	
The teachers in different schools will have comfort in teaching the computer course since the app will provide all the necessary functionalities to learn AI without them having to even lift a finger. Soon, the term AI will reach many young children as well and their curiosity will entice them in learning AI further in their future. In conclusion, this app will ease them into the various aspects of artificial intelligence.

## Problem Statement: 
	
Teach the students basic concepts/applications of Artificial Intelligence.

## Solution:

Create a mobile application to explain and interact with the domain of AI & ML.

## Solution's Novelty:

The mobile application is easy to use and all the core concepts will be available without any intricate explanation of entire domains like computer vision, reinforcement learning or NLP. The concepts will be accompanied by explanations and examples. The main structure will be viewed through effortless graphs, images and formulas.
